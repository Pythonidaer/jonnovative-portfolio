## Installation
1. Clone repository to your local device
2. Folders are structured already, so test by opening the index.html file in your browser. If it looks good, it's working right.
3. If it does not work, right-click Inspect console to determine if there is an issue with the directories.

## Usage
This repo is simply a homework assignment. Feel free to inspect the code and notice how I made a single page responsive website using Bulma components:
